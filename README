A Cryptogram Game

INTRODUCTION

Cryptograms are puzzles based typically on simple substitution
ciphers, wherein each letter of a short message is replaced with
another from the alphabet.  For details, try Wikipedia.

This short Perl script creates cryptograms from random fortunes,
assuming you have the "fortune" program installed; if not, you can
enter puzzles manually.  It also provides a nice interface for you to
work on solving them.


USAGE

perl crypto.pl

If you have "fortune" installed, crypto.pl will use it to generate a
random cryptogram.  Otherwise, you will have to manually type in one
yourself from a book, magazine, etc.

Next the cryptogram should be printed out, each line of the puzzle
followed by another with only the punctuation.  This second line is
the workspace, where your guesses will be filled in as you play.

Finally you are prompted to start on the puzzle.  If you think "A"
stands for "B", enter "AB" and the puzzle will be reprinted with your
guess displayed neatly below the cryptogram.  Change your mind about
"A", try another guess or just enter "A" and your guess disappears.

To quit the game, use ":q".  There are also commands for resetting all
your guesses (:r), starting new games (:n), saving, loading and more.
Enter "?", ":h" or ":help" to get the full list.
